# Umbra AI 🛡️

>  A privacy-first AI platform for running and scaling open models — without compromise.

**Umbra** is a platform designed to power open-source language models like **Mistral**, **LLaMA**, and **OpenChat** — with a focus on privacy, autonomy, and performance.

Built for developers, researchers, and teams who want to deploy advanced AI without handing over control to Big Tech.

---

## 🌐 Core Platform Features

-  **Model-agnostic architecture** — Supports open models like **Mistral**, **LLaMA**, and **OpenChat**, served via optimized backends
-  **Privacy-first hosted inference** — Umbra runs high-quality open models with zero tracking or data retention
-  **Built for scale** — Roadmap includes 65B+ model support, distributed inference, and fine-tuned deployments

> Note: While the current UI is based on OpenWebUI, chats will not be saved or retained in our deployment.

---

## Built for:

- Teams that need private, on-prem AI
- Builders exploring fine-tuning and custom model workflows
- Devs creating tools, apps, or agents powered by LLMs — without surrendering control

---

**Umbra is the backend infrastructure for independent AI.**

> Want to run serious models without giving your data away? Umbra gives you the tools to do it — your way.

###  Long-Term Vision: Our Own Models

While Umbra currently wraps existing open models, our long-term goal is to begin training and releasing our own models — purpose-built for user autonomy, creativity, and privacy. These models would be fine-tuned or trained from scratch on carefully curated datasets, with alignment and safety handled transparently — and without corporate filtering or behavioral bias baked in by default.

This is a big step, but one that aligns with our philosophy: users should not only control the interface, but also the intelligence behind it.

# 💸 Help Keep Umbra Independent

Umbra is built **outside of Big Tech** — with no ads, no telemetry, and no investor strings attached.

We’re a fully independent, values-aligned platform aiming to make private AI accessible to everyone. Your support helps us scale responsibly, stay transparent, and keep the platform moving fast.

## 🚧 Project Status

Umbra is under active development. The goal is to make it easier to:

- Run your **own model** (without needing a gpu cluster)
- Chat with **large models** (70B+, fine-tuned) *without needing your own GPU cluster*
- Host AI experiences that are **fully in your control**

Right now, Umbra supports 9B-class models via Ollama and other inference servers. Larger model hosting is a longer-term objective as we expand backend support and access to stronger hardware.

- A native Umbra UI (with zero-retention behavior by design) is under development.

##  Contributing

Pull requests and ideas are welcome — especially if you're passionate about:
- Privacy-first UX
- Model hosting / backend integrations
- UI polish
- Alt-model exploration (RWKV, Mixtral, etc.)
