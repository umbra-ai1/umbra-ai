# Umbra AI

> 🧠 A clean, privacy-respecting interface for open-source language models.

Umbra is a lightweight, no-tracking wrapper that lets you interact with open AI models like **Mistral**, **LLaMA**, **OpenChat**, and others — through a clean, minimal UI. Built with a focus on **autonomy**, **simplicity**, and **user freedom**.


---

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Supports open models** — Mistral, LLaMA, OpenChat, and others (via Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- 🧩 **Plug-and-play backends** — Swap between local or remote inference
- 🧼 **Minimalist frontend** — Focused UX, built for conversation not distraction
- 🛡️ **Zero tracking** — No telemetry, no user data collection, no ads
- 💬 **Experimental fine-tune support** — Goal: enable hosting & interaction with 65B+ and custom-trained models

### 🌌 Long-Term Vision: Our Own Models

While Umbra currently wraps existing open models, our long-term goal is to begin training and releasing our own models — purpose-built for user autonomy, creativity, and privacy. These models would be fine-tuned or trained from scratch on carefully curated datasets, with alignment and safety handled transparently — and without corporate filtering or behavioral bias baked in by default.

This is a big step, but one that aligns with our philosophy: users should not only control the interface, but also the intelligence behind it.

---

## 🚧 Project Status

Umbra is under active development. The goal is to make it easier to:

- Run your **own model** (without needing a gpu cluster)
- Chat with **large models** (70B+, fine-tuned) *without needing your own GPU cluster*
- Host AI experiences that are **fully in your control**

Right now, Umbra supports 9B-class models via Ollama and other inference servers. Larger model hosting is a longer-term objective as we expand backend support and access to stronger hardware.

# 💸 Support Umbra

**Umbra** is a privacy-first AI interface and assistant stack — built without Big Tech, surveillance, or compromise.

We’re fully independent, community-supported, and committed to building usable, values-aligned AI tools for power users, self-hosters, and anyone who wants control over their own digital intelligence.

Your support helps us stay lean, ethical, and fast-moving — without ads, trackers, or lock-in.

## ✅ Why Support?

- 🧠 Scale GPU infrastructure (host larger models: 30B–65B+)
- 🛠️ Fund fine-tuning and future Umbra-native models
- 🧪 Keep experiments open and transparent
- 🛡️ Remain independent from corporate influence
- 🤝 Prioritize user freedom, privacy, and control
