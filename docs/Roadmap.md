# 📍 Umbra Product Roadmap

Umbra is a privacy-first AI interface and backend platform designed to let users interact with open models — without compromise. While it leverages open technologies, Umbra itself is built as a product, not a community-maintained open-source project.

This roadmap outlines what’s live, what’s in development, and where we’re headed next.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Private Minimal MVP (Live)

> Core features in production

- Minimal chat UI (streaming, markdown )
- Hosting of 7B–9B open models via Ollama backend
- Anonymous public access: [umbraai.xyz](https://umbraai.xyz)
- No telemetry / tracking / log storage
- Model switching support
- Persona presets (customizable system prompts)

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Personal + Pro & Self-Hosted UI

> Tools for power users, enthusiasts, and developers

- Self-hostable UI deployment for self-hosting enthusiests (Docker + cloud scripts)
- Switch between local and remote inference providers (Usefull for those who want to use thier own API keys)
- UI refinements (themes, accessibility controls)
- Optional “pro” tier with higher-tier inference access

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Hosted Expansion (Larger Models)

> Adding paid tiers and stronger hosted models

- Hosted access to 30B–65B+ models (subject to availability)
- Curated fine-tunes (code, logic, etc.)
- Shared community instance with boosted performance
- Prioritized load for donors or subscribers
- Dedicated GPU node access (coming soon)

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: Umbra-Owned Model IP

> Strategic direction: proprietary models aligned with user freedom

Umbra’s long-term goal is to train and offer its own models — starting with fine-tunes on permissive bases, and eventually exploring original pretraining.

These models will be:

- Fine-tuned for user control, creativity, and minimal censorship
- Available through Umbra’s hosted platform or licensing
- Aligned to privacy-first deployment — no tracking, no cloud lock-in
- Built to differentiate the Umbra product from generic wrappers

We’re not just building a UI — we’re building an intelligent assistant stack that reflects **your values**, not Silicon Valley’s.

## 💸 Support & Sustainability

Umbra is a bootstrapped product. Your use, feedback, and donations help us:

- Scale infrastructure to support larger models
- Invest in fine-tuning and future model training
- Stay independent, lean, and non-exploitative

Every bit goes toward hosting costs and open development.

Commercial tiers and partner licenses are coming in 2026.
