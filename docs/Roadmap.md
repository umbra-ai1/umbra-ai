# 📍 Umbra Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines what’s live, what’s in development, and where we’re headed next.

---

##  Phase 1: Private Minimal MVP (Live)

> Core platform features currently in production

- Minimal chat UI (streaming, markdown support)
- Hosted inference for 7B–9B parameter open models via vLLM backend
- Anonymous, public access at [umbraai.xyz](https://umbraai.xyz)
- Strict privacy: no telemetry, no tracking, no log storage
- Basic model switching support
- Persona presets (customizable system prompts)

---

##  Phase 2: Power & Pro Tiers

> Enhancements for advanced users and commercial customers

- Refined UI with improved themes and accessibility controls
- Optional “Pro” tier offering priority access and higher-performance inference
- Expanded hosted model selection including curated fine-tunes
- User account management and usage dashboards
- API access for integrating Umbra platform capabilities into apps and workflows

---

##  Phase 3: Hosted Expansion & Scaling

> Growing hosted infrastructure and model capacity

- Launch of hosted access to 30B–65B+ parameter models (availability dependent on hardware)
- Scalable distributed inference to improve latency and throughput
- Dedicated GPU node options for high-demand customers
- Load prioritization for subscribers and donors
- Continued enhancements to privacy and security at scale

---

##  Phase 4: Umbra-Native Models & IP

> Strategic vision: proprietary models aligned with user autonomy

Umbra’s long-term mission includes training and releasing its own models — starting with fine-tuned variants on permissive open bases, and eventually original pretraining.

These models will be:

- Optimized for user control, creativity, and minimal censorship
- Exclusively available through Umbra’s hosted platform and licensing partners
- Designed for privacy-first deployment — no tracking, no cloud lock-in
- A key differentiator positioning Umbra beyond generic open-source wrappers

We’re building more than an interface —  
Umbra is a full AI platform centered on **your freedom and values**, not corporate agendas.

> For those who want real intelligence —  
> without filters, tracking, or strings attached.
