# 💸 Support Umbra

**Umbra** is a privacy-first AI interface and assistant stack — built without Big Tech, surveillance, or compromise.

We’re fully independent, community-supported, and committed to building usable, values-aligned AI tools for power users, self-hosters, and anyone who wants control over their own digital intelligence.

Your support helps us stay lean, ethical, and fast-moving — without ads, trackers, or lock-in.
